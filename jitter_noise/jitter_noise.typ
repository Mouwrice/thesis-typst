= Reducing Jitter and Noise <jitter-noise>

The measurements show that the pose estimation suffers from jitter and noise. It is, of course, preferred to have as little of this jitter and noise as possible. This section describes a post-processing method to reduce the jitter and noise from the pose estimation. While not entirely eliminating the jitter and noise, the method is shown to reduce it.
